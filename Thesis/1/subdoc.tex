\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}
Computers have been widely used in music performances for many years. Some
advanced systems use the computer as a independent module to replace a
single instrument in an orchestra. In popular music computers have proved
to be particularly successful. Both classical and popular music have many
opportunities for innovative applications used by highly intelligent and
coordinated computer music systems. With more powerful algorithms and more
advanced sensing devices, computer music systems have the potential to
replace musicians. In the future, computer music systems will inspire new 
musical directions based on new
capabilities and generate new concepts from new technologies.

Live popular music offers a wealth of opportunities for computing and music
research.  We refer to the integration of computers as independent autonomous
performers into popular live music performances as Human Computer Music
Performance (HCMP) \cite{Hcmp0}, \cite{Hcmp1}, \cite{Dannenberga}, \cite{Gold2011}.
In HCMP, computers become more than instruments and are,
to some degree, seen as performers. To bring HCMP into the realm of popular
music performance, certain problems need to be solved. 

One problem is that
popular music is organized around a tight synchronization to beats, and a
computer cannot reliably and efficiently adapt to human tempo variations.
Another significant problem is that an HCMP project is a large complex
system which contains many components, each one relying on the cooperation of several
different subcomponents to complete its task.

The motivation behind the HCMP Player is to provide a good solution to these
problems. When successful, the HCMP Player will display different
representations of music, work as an accompanist and quickly adjust its
tempo to follow the performer. A clearly defined programming interface is
also required in order to foster communication and cooperation with all
components within the system. To create such a player, we must coordinate
time between different media. We need at least two functional components,
one component working as ``backend'' and responsible for coordinating and
scheduling different music events, the other, working as ``frontend'' will
receive commands from the user or other components and dynamically adjust
play sequences and tempo based on those requests.

This paper begins with the role of the HCMP Player in the HCMP project. Then
the ``big picture of'' of the HCMP project will be discussed, followed by a
presentation of the individual HCMP components. Finally the question of how
the HMCP Player fits into the whole picture will be addressed. In the
following three chapters design issues with the HCMP Player are addressed.
Each chapter approaches the problem from a different perspective. Chapter 2
describes the design of Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the HCMP Player together
with a detailed explanation of all the GUI components' usage and function.
Chapter 3 describes the ``backend'' of the HCMP Player - the player engine,
and illustrates how the player engine cooperates and communicates with the
GUI to complete external requests. Chapter 4 addresses the network
communication problem between multiple players. A API is
defined to integrate the HCMP Player with other components in the HCMP
project.  Chapter 5 describes the implementation details of the HCMP Player
and includes pseudocode to provide a clear explanation of this. Chapter 6
focuses on the evaluation of the HCMP Player. A full list of features
will be given and a clear success criteria used to evaluate the HCMP Player
will be defined. In Chapter 7, I summarize my work and propose possible
future works.

\section{Background}

Before making a formal introduction to the background of HCMP Player, 
I would like to make a short review of  
some existing human computer music systems. The most common use of 
computers in
music performance is in computer instruments, typically keyboards.
These, and other electronic instruments, are essentially substitutes 
for traditional
instruments and rely upon human musicians for their control and 
coordination with other musicians. 

Many composers of interactive contemporary art music use computers
to generate music in real time, often in response to live performers.
These systems are rarely capable of synchronizing to rhythmic playing
so these techniques are not very useful for traditional or popular music 
forms.

Another use of the computer in music is in computer accompaniment systems 
\cite{Roger:89}, 
which solve the synchronization problem by assuming a pre-determined 
score (music notation). During the performance, a performer expressively 
plays music score while the accompaniment system ``listens'' and make a analysis, 
then follows the performer 
in the score and synchronizes an accompaniment.

In live popular music performance, computers can be quite useful too.
The computer has had a significant
impact on popular music through drum machines, sequencers and loop-based
interfaces, but one can argue that popular music has adapted to new technology
rather than the other way around. The sound and beat of drum machines seems stiff,
mechanical, and monotonous to many musicians, but that became the trance-like
foundation of club dance music and other forms. Similarly, 
the inability of
sequencers and other beat-based software to “listen” to human musicians has led to
performances with click tracks in fixed media or simply a fixed drum track that live
musicians must follow. Ableton Live \cite{Ableton:2011} is an example of software that
uses a beat, measure, and section framework to synchronize music in live
performance, but the program is not well suited to adapting to the tempo of live
musicians. Robertson and Plumbley \cite{Robertson:2007} used a real-time beat 
tracker in
conjunction with Ableton Live software to synchronize pre-recorded music 
to a live drummer. This extension could be considered HCMP.
Table 1.1 summarizes some existing computer music systems and their usage.

\section{Objective}
The objective of HCMP \cite{Dawen:2011} is to create an autonomous 
``artificial performer'' with the ability of a human musical performer. 
Ideally, HCMP should not require a human operator instead, the system itself 
be adaptive and responsive. With a sophisticated listening and sensing
component, HCMP is able to adjust system parameters in real-time during 
performance. 

From a functional perspective, we can divide HCMP into two main
categories: music preparation and music performance. The music preparation
part aims to work with and understand multiple music representations in order
to prepare material for performance. The music
performance part deals with music.     

An important component of the music performance part is the HCMP Player, 
which is able to flexibly  
adjust and respond to changes of music signal. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship 
between the scheduler, conductor and HCMP Player. During performance, the HCMP Player will 
be controlled by conductor and constantly receive control messages 
from the conductor. In this project, I have designed, and implemented the HCMP player 
for the HCMP project.

\section{HCMP Player Architecture}
The HCMP Player is mainly made up of two threads, that we call the GUI thread 
and the performer thread. The GUI thread takes care of user input, maintaining 
graphic state. The performer thread plays MIDI file synchronously with other 
players, each thread is an independent 
module. The two threads communicate with each other through a pair of shared 
message queues. We assume the message 
queue is large enough to avoid blocking by thread. The performer thread
handles time-critical operations, and there will be a timer setup 
before this thread is created. The goal of the timer is to 
wake up the performer thread periodically. Every time the performer 
thread's timer callback function is invoked, 
it will check the message queue and process any command from the control thread.
Figure 2 illustrates the overall structure of the Player.

\end{figure}

During the performance, the HCMP Player will act as 
the server for the conductor component, which is constantly 
receiving control messages and responding accordingly. The
conductor receives and forwards message to start and stop playing,
set the position, and change the tempo.
