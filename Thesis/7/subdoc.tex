\section{Overview}
Chapter 6 mainly focus on evaluation of the project. In 
this chapter, we define the successful criteria of the project and discuss
how to meet those requirements. A complete list of required features is
listed. At last part of chapter, we also make brief performance test and 
discuss some potential performance issues.

\section{Functional Evaluation}
Based on the project design from previous chapters, the evaluation of the 
project mainly contains 
two parts. To reach the successful criteria, the project not only need to 
satisfy the functional requirement but also all of performance requirements. 
The 
functional requirement cover all the basic function of the HCMP Player, 
each functional requirement will be 
either manully tested or automatically tested by scripts. As for the
performance test, some code segment will be added to original program to
test the general performance issues.

\subsection{Stand-alone Mode Requirement}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User should be able to load and play normal midi files.
  \item User should be able to play, pause, stop while playing midi file.  
  \item User should be able to freely adjust tempo, while plying the midi file.   
  \item Data visualization component should correctly show the midi note 
        and synchronize with audio stream while playing the midi file.
  \item Each track component should match to color on data visualization component.
  \item Each track component should be able to mute, solo and adjust volume.  
  \item The player should contain a simple midi library to manage midi files. 
        The library should automatically remember recently imported midi files.
  \item The player should provide a complete configuraion interface for the 
        user, all user's setting should be saved automatically.
  \item The configuration of HCMP Player should be saved into a file.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Network Mode Requirement}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Each instance of HCMP Player runs in its own process space, one player 
        should not effect other player's function or performance. 
        
  \item Each HCMP Plyaer should be launched separately by user. After 
        launching, the midi player should automatically connect to a conductor 
        based on its configuration.

  \item If HCMP Player failed to establish connection with remote server, it should  
        be rollback to stand-alone mode without crashing.
  \item The Conductor communicate with midi player through a predefined API, 
        the API is defined in Chpater 5. After establishing connection with remote   
        server, HCMP Player should register into Conductor's dependent list.   
        Once received command, the Conductor send message to all HCMP Player that    
        previously registered in the dependent list. 

  \item Multiple instances of midi player should be able to connect to one conductor. 
  \item After establishing connection with conductor, the midi player 
        should be able to receive tempo informaiton from conductor and 
        synchronize with it.     
  \item The conductor should be able to explicitly command certain midi player to 
        load specified configuration file or it could directly 
        send configuration information through network to that midi player.
  \item 
    The HCMP Player is compatible with ZeroMQ \cite{zeromq} api, 
    and 4 core functions will be like
    \begin{itemize}
      \item play - ask a player to start playing 
      \item stop - stop a player from playing 
      \item update time-map - send new time-map to the player 
      \item set position - set position to certain beat 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Requirement}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The HCMP Player GUI part should always response to user input without 
        significant delay, and the GUI thread should not hang there.
  \item The HCMP Player should response to conductor without significant delay.
  \item The HCMP Player should use no more than 100MB memory.
  \item The HCMP Player should use reasonable amount of CPU while playing midi file.
  \item Hopefully, the midi player shoud not crash without any reason. 
\end{enumerate}
